# Odin Recipes

Built as part of the learning path on The Odin Project, Odin Recipes showcases recipes in a HTML website.

## Usage

This is intended as a personal repository for successful recipes I have made. As such, I am including my own personal preferences and modifications to recipes from other sources (NYTimes Cooking, Tasty, etc.).
